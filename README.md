Scope of our Project

Targets anyone who is part of a team working on a group project.

 

Brief description:

A group project management web application which aims to solve the problems faced by group individuals and facilitate smooth project completion.

 

Problems

In group projects, it is difficult to keep track of the individual contributions of each member, and thus some members would have to do more work while others get away with contributing less to the project

Hard to assign tasks to members fairly without a random allocation system which takes the difficulty of tasks into account

Groups usually overestimate the amount of time they have to work on the project, which results in them leaving the project to the last minute

Difficult to enforce internal deadlines or provide feedback on other members as it might strain personal relationships

No way to visualize the group progress to help the group see if they are on schedule

Troublesome to arrange a meeting time that fits the schedule of all members without a proper group calendar to identify suitable time slots





Features:

Implementation of a points-based system to reward and track work completion.

Akin to that of a to-do list, our system enables the creation of tasks that includes user-specified difficulty rating of each tasks, measured in points.

Tasks will be randomly allocated (or manually if the group chooses to do so) to group members based on the points of each task, and the number of points each member has accumulated from completion of other tasks.

Once a member has completed a task, he will mark it as completed and gain points. Group members who disagree can provide anonymous feedback and the completion status will be placed on hold until it is resolved.

The point based system will allow for a fair allocation of tasks and all members can see the amount of work other members have done

The system will also keep track of deadlines input by the group and remind members regularly of these deadlines via email. Deadlines missed will be recorded for the group to keep track of their progress
 

We also plan to construct a group calendar that can be viewed by all members to identify suitable group meeting time slots

Social media integration (NUS IVLE, Facebook, Google Plus, etc)

Built-in alerts informing other members that someone has completed his task

 

 

Additional Features:

Construct a visualization of project statistics such as contributions over time, etc  for the group to track their progress on the project

Print a report summarizing the project statistics



Proposed level of achievement

Apollo 11




Motivation

Group projects are very common in many areas of life, yet people struggle with group projects since they are difficult to manage. We wish to empower people with such a project management application so that the projects can be executed successfully and smoothly.

 

User stories:

 

As a leader of a group, I need to distribute tasks appropriately to other group members. To do this, the system should allow me to input the task and randomly or manually allocate it to members in the group based on difficulty.

As a member of a group, I need to communicate easily with other members of the group. To do this, the system should allow me to chat directly to other members in the group.

As a member of a group, I need to be able to keep track of deadlines. To do this, the system should remind me of deadlines that have been inputted to me (if my task deadline is approaching) or the entire group (if a group level deadline is approaching).

As a leader of a group, I need to be able to keep track of the group’s schedule so that I can find an appropriate time slot to conduct a group meeting. To do this, the system should allow me to view the entire group’s calendar and identify time slots where all members are available.

As a member of a group, I need to know if my group is on pace to completing the project. To do this, the system should allow me to visualize the progress of the project through graph and analytics.

As a project grader, I am interested in knowing the different contributions of group members in the project in order to determine whether all members of the group deserve to be graded equally. To do this, the system should be able to generate a summary of the work done by each individual in the group.
 

 

For the next sprint, our group shall do features 1,3 and 4.
